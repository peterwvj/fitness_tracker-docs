Fitness Tracker Application Privacy Policy

Last updated: April 18, 2020.

CEPK ("we" or "us" or "our") respects the privacy of our users ("user"
or "you"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose,
and safeguard your information when you visit our application (the
"Application"). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. IF YOU DO
NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS
THE APPLICATION.

We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any
time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by
updating the "Last updated" date of this Privacy Policy. You are
encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed
of updates. You will be deemed to have been made aware of, will be
subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted the changes in any
revised Privacy Policy by your continued use of the Application after
the date such revised Privacy Policy is posted.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the third-party online/mobile
store from which you install the Application or make payments. We are
not responsible for any of the data collected by any third parties
that the Application relies on.

COLLECTION OF YOUR INFORMATION

The Application needs camera access to:

1. Scan barcodes, which are used to retrieve information about food
   products ("products") from the [[https://world.openfoodfacts.org/][Open Food Facts]] (OFF) third-party
   database and assisting users with entering barcodes for newly
   created products.

2. Take product photos, which may optionally be attached to product
   changes submitted to OFF.

The Application requires Internet access to:

1. Retrieve information about OFF products, creating new OFF products,
   and submitting changes to existing OFF products. Optionally, the
   user may provide the Application with personal OFF credentials in
   order to have all product changes associated with the user's own
   OFF account. If the user does not specify personal OFF credentials,
   the Application will use an OFF account associated with the
   Application itself for submitting product changes on behalf of the
   user. In that case, the user's Firebase authentication UID is added
   to the request so that OFF can distinguish product changes
   submitted by one user from product changes submitted by another
   user.

2. Log in. The Application uses [[http://firebase.google.com/][Firebase]]/Social login to authenticate
   its users and manage them. The Application will use information
   available via the social network account (name, profile image etc.)
   to show the user who is currently logged in to the Application.

The Application stores the following information on the device that it
runs on:

1. Meal plan related information provided by the user.

2. User settings/preferences.

3. OFF credentials (if provided by the user), which are used to
   authenticate against OFF when creating/editing OFF products. OFF
   passwords are stored/protected with [[https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_secure_storage][Flutter Secure Storage]].
